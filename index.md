## Computer Scientist turned UX Designer.

I use this website primarily for blogging my thoughts and ideas.
elliotthuge.dev is inspired by:
* NoBoilerPlate
* The Cult of Done '*manifesto*'
* gwern.net
* A general obsession with Markdown

### AI content declaration:

This site, and some of its content*, was built with the assistance of generative AI.

*_I intend to make a post about an AI declaration 'standard', e.g. marking pure-human origin content with `Hu`._
